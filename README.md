| Indicator | Observation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Spoofed Sender** | Claimed to be Netflix, but sent from `seb@caniphish.com`, which is not an official Netflix domain. |
| **Urgent Language** | Uses fear tactic: "Your password is due to expire in 3 days." |
| **Suspicious Link/Button** | “Reset Password” button likely redirects to a phishing site to steal login credentials. |
| **Spelling/Grammar Mistakes** | “Netflix are requesting...” – bad grammar (Netflix *is* a singular noun). |
| **Social Engineering** | Triggers fear by mentioning "account compromises." |
| **Lack of Personalization** | Appears personalized with “Hi Alice” but could be easily automated. |
| **No Digital Signature** | No sign of a verified sender or digital signature from Netflix. |
